This repository contains a collection of personal projects that demonstrate my programming skills!

1. Estimating Ï€ Using the Monte-Carlo Method

This was a simple homework problem from my thermodynamics and statistical mechanics class. This was done by generating random x-y points ranging from -1 to 1 and calculating the ratio of points within the unit circle to the total number of points. It was an introduction to the MonteCarlo Method, which can be used for creating realistic molecular simulations. 

2. PDFtoExcelTableConverter for Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery

The Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery and allied procedures is a comprehensive suite of neuropsychological tests used to assess the condition and functioning of the brain, including etiology, type, localization and lateralization of brain injury. My sister administers these tests for her work by referencing tables within the accompanied book. To automate some of her work, she wanted these tables to be accessible in excel. To help her, I figured out a systematic, error resistant way to digitize the tables and export them to an excel file. I learned the usefulness of digitized, accessible information and the need for technological talent to make diagnostics fast and accurate in the field of medicine. 

3. Annual Energy Use of Clothes Dryers

For my chemical engineering lab, I learned how to modify heat convection process by running experiments. While doing this, I needed to write a sustainability assessment that identified ways to make heat convection processes more efficient in our day-to-day lives. One of the biggest ways to do this is by decreasing the use of clothes dryers or investing in clothes dryers that integrate heat pump technlogy. Using public data from the US Environmental Protection Agency, I made a box and whisker plot to compare the energy use of tradtional and heat pump-equipped clothes dryers. Based on the analysis, switching from traditional to heat pump-equipped clothes dryers leads to a 67% decrease in annual energy consumption.
